                    Make sure you have a spare key hidden outside your house
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s happened to all of us. We lock our door, go about our day, and when we come home…our key doesn’t work. Maybe we left it in the lock or dropped it somewhere along the way, but either way, we’re locked out and don’t know what to do. In this article, we’ll discuss some tips on how to avoid getting locked out of your house in the first place and what to do if you find yourself in this situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the best ways to avoid getting locked out of your house is to have a spare key hidden outside your home. This could be anywhere from behind a flower pot to buried in the garden; just make sure it’s somewhere where you can quickly get to it if you need it. Another option is to use a <a style="color:#fcc236" href="https://magnetlocksmith.com/commercial-locksmith-services/">magnet locksmith Houston</a> who can install a <a style="color:#fcc236" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_keyed_lock">magnetic lock</a> on your front door that will only open with a unique key. This is an excellent option if you often lose your keys, as you won’t have to worry about being locked out again.

                    Ask a neighbor to keep an eye on your house while you're gone

                <p>
                    Ask a neighbor to keep an eye on your home while you’re gone. If they know you’ll be out of town, they can keep an eye on your property and let you know if anything seems suspicious. You can also give them a key to let themselves in if necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a security system, make sure it’s turned on and set to notify you if anyone tries to break in. You should also have a backup plan if your power goes out or your system fails. Make sure all the doors and windows are locked when you leave your house. If you have a garage, be sure to lock that as well. If you have valuables in your home, consider hiding them in a safe place or taking them with you.

                            Install a smart lock that can be opened with your phone

                        <p>
                            No one ever thinks about getting locked out of their house until it happens. And by then, it’s usually too late. You’re standing on the porch, shivering in the cold, and all you can do is hope that a neighbour will walk by and let you in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But there are ways to avoid this scenario entirely. The most obvious solution is to install a smart lock on your door that can be opened with your phone. That way, if you forget your keys or lose them, you can still get into your house without calling a locksmith.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another option is to keep a spare key hidden somewhere outside your home. This could be under a rock or flower pot near the door, or inside a fake rock or statue. Make sure you choose a spot that’s easy for you to remember and won’t be discovered by burglars.

                <p>
                    Keep a copy of your house key in your car or at work. This is probably the easiest way to ensure that you’ll never be locked out of your home. If you always have a key with you, you’ll still be able to get inside even if you forget yours. Another option is to give a spare key to a trusted friend or family member who lives nearby. If you ever get locked out, you can just call them, and they can come over and let you in. If you have a security system, make sure to include a lock code that you can remember. That way, even if you lose your keys, you’ll still be able to get into your house by inputting the code.

                <h2>
                    Have a friend or family member check on your house while you're away
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can have a friend or family member check on your house periodically while you’re gone. They could stop by once a day, or even once a week, to make sure everything is okay. Another option is to park their car in your driveway to look like someone is home. If there’s no one available to check on your house, consider hiring a security company to do it for you. They can keep an eye on things and ensure that no one breaks in while you’re away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, make sure that your doors and windows are locked before leaving home. It might seem like common sense, but sometimes we get busy and forget to do something as simple as locking the door behind us. By taking these precautions
